Project title: C to Python Translator for While Statement

 Project description:
"C to Python Translator for While Statement" is a Python-based software tool designed to help students and developers translate C code into Python. 
The primary focus is on translating 'while' loops, but the tool handles some other C constructs as well.

The tool uses the 'pycparser' library to parse C code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), allowing us to analyze and understand the structure of the code. Additionally, 'graphviz' is used to visualize these structures, particularly focusing on 'while' loops.
After parsing, the tool systematically translates C syntax into Python. The goal is to produce Python code that retains the logic and functionality of the original C code but leverages Python's syntax and features.

This tool is particularly useful for students transitioning from C to Python, providing them with a resource to see how common patterns in C can be implemented in Python. It also assists in educational settings where understanding the differences between these two languages is crucial.
I believe this project can be a valuable educational tool, and I am eager to discuss its potential applications in our curriculum.
